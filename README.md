With Working Zone we mean a method, conceived for address bus, finalized to the transformation of a received memory address. The aim is to design a hardware component that implements the Working Zone coding method. The module, after reading an address from the memory to which it interfaces, returns a particular encoding depending on whether or not the address given as input belongs to one of the working areas.
